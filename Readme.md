# Real_estate_price_prediction
## Overview
This project aims to predict house prices based on various features using machine learning techniques. We have performed extensive data preprocessing to ensure accurate predictions. Additionally, we have created a web user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for dynamic interaction with the model.


## Features

- Multiple features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, etc. are considered for predicting house prices.
- Data preprocessing techniques like feature scaling, handling missing values, and categorical encoding have been applied to ensure data quality.
## Model

- We have trained a machine learning model using a suitable algorithm to predict house prices.
- The model has been selected using hyperparameter tuning using SearchCvs to get best possible accuracy
##  Web  Interface

- To provide a user-friendly experience, we have developed a web user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- The interface allows users to input the required features and obtain predicted house prices in real-time.
## Usage

#### Clone the repository.
- Open command prompt and go to your directory using

```bash
   cd path/to_your/directory
```
- Now clone the repo using - 
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abhisharma2408/Real_estate_price_prediction.git
```
#### Install the required dependencies.
```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Run the web application locally.
- Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
- Input the desired features and obtain predicted house prices.
